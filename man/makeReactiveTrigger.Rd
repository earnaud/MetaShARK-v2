makeReactiveTrigger(dev = FALSE, label = "")

\description{
Create a 'reactiveTrigger' object (NOT a proper R class) with two methods:
\enumerate{
\item depend() : must be written in a code chunk to execute on triggering
\item trigger() : when executed, trigger the object (and all the "depending"
code chunks)
